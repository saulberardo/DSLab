## Comments
* In [McCAnn et al, 2017] there are references to other paper with accuracies as high as 94.1.

* I don't know if ther results in the Benchmarks above are totaly comparable due to possible
differences in test setup.

* In Kaggle's IMDB toy competition LB, there are accuracies as high as 0.99259, but
possibly they were achieved with emsembles, not single models as in the Benchmarks
